Surf is the Maple package for differential geometry of surfaces, with functions to ease interdisciplinary modeling in curved systems. 


## Getting Started

The  usual  differential operators  for  a  given  surface are  implemented,  so  that  an  arbitrary  model can  be  immediately  mapped from flat to curved space.
