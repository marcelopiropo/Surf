## The Maple package Surf   
We introduce Surf, a Maple package for differential geometry of surfaces, with functions to ease interdisciplinary modeling in curved systems. The main idea is to have a parametrized surface as input and, as output, a model  system  on  curved  surface.

The  usual  differential operators  for  a  given  surface are  implemented,  so  that  an  arbitrary  model can  be  immediately  mapped from flat to curved space.  The simplicity of our approach is illustrated with some examples in a variety of interdisciplinary problems:  diffusion on a curved space, quantum mechanics on surfaces, and modeling the trajectory of a C. elegans worm.
